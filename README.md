# Testing CVaR on QAOA
## Before using this code
This code uses a library for simulation variational quantum algorithms that can be found using this link: [git@github.com:aqp-mc2-chalmers/vqa.git](https://github.com/aqp-mc2-chalmers/vqa.git). 
Before using our code, the vqa library has to be installed in the same folder. The installation steps can be found in the vqa repository previously linked.


## Code
The simulation of CVaR on QAOA using the COBYLA optimizer is done in the Parameter_test_COBYLA.ipynb file. Graphical representation of the results is done in the Data_analisys.ipynb file. A few datafiles of the simulations done during the bachelor's thesis are included for the user to look at. Testing the variance due to using a different amount of samples is done in the CVar_variance_test.ipynb file.
